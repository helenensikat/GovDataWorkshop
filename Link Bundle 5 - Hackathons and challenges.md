## What's a hackathon?
Hackathons bring people with varying backgrounds together to form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively develop unique solutions.  These solutions frequently take the form of websites, mobile apps, and analysis or visualisations of data.

Effective hackathon teams are often diverse ones - sometimes, they may even be composed of people who have just met at the event. Good teams generally contain a mix of technical people (developers, designers) and non-technical (researchers, project managers, problem owners, & journalists).

Most importantly, hackathons are not about getting a finished product.  Their key outcomes are ideas, new approaches, and community outreach and engagement.

## Setting good challenges
Well-designed problems are critical.  Remember that:
- overly defined and scoped outcomes don’t make for good challenges. Questions with with a pre-designed outcome won't help you get the most out of the event;
- your problem shouldn’t read like you’re writing a tender - be wary of providing highly detailed specifications; and
- you’ll get more value from hackathons and challenges if you don’t steer people towards a given answer, and if you use clear, non-buzzwordy language.

It's also important to manage expectations.  For instance:
- appreciate that you will always get a fresh perspective on your problem, but it may not be precisely what you had in mind; and
- don’t expect participants to turn up with a comprehensive understanding of your business or industry - the value that they can add frequently comes from their different perspectives and ability to approach the problem by asking naive questions.

## Prototype to practice
Hackathons may provide a range of new ideas and approaches for your department.  However, to maintain a productive, ongoing relationship with the developer community, it's important not to treat them as cheap or free procurement.  So how do we take ideas to the next step?  Options include direct procurement, contracting staff in, running incubator programs, and offering grants.  Engaging with your local startup community can also help you understand what participants might need in terms of support, structure, and funding.
