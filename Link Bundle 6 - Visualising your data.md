Good presentation of data, information, and knowledge is key to effectively informing and engaging with the wider community.

Making complex data meaningful to the mum and dad who just want to understand what the electricity market is doing, without having them wade through the data themselves; or making a public transport map that is both beautiful and informative.

# NationalMap
The NationalMap is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian government agencies. It is an initiative of the Department of Communications and the Arts now currently managed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the software has been developed by Data61 working closely with the Department of Communications and the Arts, Geoscience Australia and other government agencies.

The NationalMap:

- provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public
- facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
- provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation
