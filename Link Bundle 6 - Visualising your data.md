Good presentation of data, information, and knowledge is key to effectively informing and engaging with the wider community.  Data visualisation goes to the heart of this.

Sometimes agencies themselves are the ones creating dashboards, visualisations, and novel ways of presenting their data.  And sometimes they are the ones releasing data into the wild; data that others  - hobbyists, professionals, and data journalists - can use to tell a story.

Whatever the source, these stories and images can make complex data meaningful and navigable for citizens who want to know more about their government and the services it delivers.

# NationalMap
The NationalMap is a website for map-based access to spatial data from Australian government agencies. It was an initiative of the Department of Communications and the Arts, and is managed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.  The software was developed by Data61, working closely with the Department of Communications and the Arts, Geoscience Australia, and other agencies.

The NationalMap:

- provides easy access to spatial data to government, businesses, and the public;
- makes it easier for Commonwealth, State and local government bodies to open up spatial data; and
- provides an open framework of geospatial data services to support commercial and community innovation.
