# Information Bundle No.3: Open data and government
The ideas of open government and open data are tightly interlinked, with open government serving as the overarching concept for open data. While there are many interpretations of open government, it may be summed up as a rights-based approach giving citizens access to the workings of government.

*The Open Definition* sums up open data as:

> "Open means **anyone** can **freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose** (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness)."
