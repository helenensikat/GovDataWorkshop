## Information Bundle No.1: Data analytics, big data, & data linkage

Data Analytics: Involves collecting raw data and using it to derive information that can inform decision-makers.

This can mean identifying patterns and meaning in routinely collected data.  Addressing complex policy problems, reavealing how programs result in particular outcomes.  Working together to understand issues that span multiple agencies, & design evidence based policy.

### Big Data

Big data: datasets too large and complex to be processed, searched, and analyed using traditional techniques.
