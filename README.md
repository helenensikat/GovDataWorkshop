This site provides materials and resources for the 'How to use your data to its full potential' masterclass.

The masterclass focuses on getting more value out of your data, and using it to its full potential.  It is designed to give you a very broad taste of current issues around data and government, direct you towards issues you may wish to learn more about, and provide you with materials you can take back to your organisation.
